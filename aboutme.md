## About Me<br>
Hi! 👋🏻 <br>
I'm Cynthia Clifford.<br><br>
I am a Data Analyst. I'm a former Mechanical Engineer and a former Math Educator. <br><br>
I love numbers. <br>
**My superpowers 💪 are analysis, statistics, and sleep!**<br>
Feel free to connect and say hi! <br><br>
- 📊 Starting out I wanted to do math.<br>
- ⚡  Ended up in energy conservation R&D. Great projects but no fun in the individual role and didn’t allow for enough creativity.<br>
- 🧾 Became a teacher in hopes of inspiring others to love learning as much as I do. And to see the world (I’ve worked in 12 countries).<br>
- 📊 Teaching AP Statistics, I realized my true passion was analyzing data and using my creativity to communicate findings.<br>
- 👍🏻 Needed to continue learning with upskilling - started Google’s Data Analytics Career Certificate and then completed the Data Analytics Accelerator Program. <br>
- 💥 Learned the tools of data analysis: **Excel/Sheets, Tableau, R, SQL, and Python**, applied them to projects, and **built a portfolio.** <br>
- 🤓 The combination of my improving tech skills and my analysis and presentation skills will enable me to make a strong contribution to a company. <br>
- 🤓 I also bring problem-solving skills, persistence, project management, a strong work ethic, and the flexibility to handle pressure and change with grace.<br>
- 👑 Joined Stack Education’s Data Analytics program through the University of Vermont and am continually learning.<br>
- 🔎 Started working on a short-term data contract at Snow Data Science to continue to gain experience in the data world.<br>
- 🔎 Seeking a full-time permanent role.<br><br>
