## About Me<br>
My name is Cynthia Clifford. **I love patterns, problem-solving, and going down the rabbit hole to solve juicy problems.**  I am passionate about using data to create actionable insights and inform decision-making. I’ve gained valuable experience through work projects and personal projects, and have a strong foundation in tools and technologies such as **Excel/Sheets, Tableau, Excel, R, and SQL.** I’m currently learning Python.<br><br>
I have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Education. I have worked as an engineer and as an international school math educator. Through those experiences, I’ve developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills and excellent presentation and communication skills. I know how to **communicate complex ideas in terms that are understandable.** <br><br>
I’ve lived and **worked in 12 countries outside of the US**, demonstrating my flexibility, curiosity, and adaptability. I’ve also been a team leader, department head, and teacher trainer. My experience in leadership has strengthened my analytical and problem-solving abilities, and my desire to use data to improve programs. I want to use these skills to **transition into an analytics role**.<br><br>
I am excited to bring my analytical skills, leadership experience, and education to a data analyst role. I’m a self-motivated life-long learner and will continue my professional development in this field because it is FUN. I am confident that my combination of education and experience makes me a strong candidate, and I am eager to use my skills to help organizations achieve their goals.<br><br>
On a personal note, I love scuba diving, hiking, yoga, cooking, hiking, music, swimming, and travel.<be>

About Me:

📊 Started out wanting to do math. 

⚡ Ended up in energy conservation R&D. Great projects but no fun in the individual role and didn’t allow for enough creativity.

🧾 Became a teacher in hopes of inspiring others to love learning as much as I do. And to see the world (I’ve worked in 12 countries).

📊 Teaching AP Statistics, I realized my true passion was analyzing data and using my creativity to communicate findings.

👍🏻 Needed to continue learning with upskilling - started Google’s Data Analytics Career Certificate and then completed the Data Analytics Accelerator Program.

💥 Learned the tools of data analysis: Excel/Sheets, Tableau, R, SQL, and Python, applied them to projects, and built a portfolio. 

🤓 The combination of my improving tech skills and my analysis and presentation skills will enable me to make a strong contribution to a company.

🤓 I also bring problem-solving skills, persistence, project management, a strong work ethic, and the flexibility to handle pressure and change with grace.

👑 Joined Stack Education’s Data Analytics program through the University of Vermont and am continually learning.

🔎 Started working a short-term data contract to continue to gain experience in the data world.

🔎 Seeking a full-time permanent role.
