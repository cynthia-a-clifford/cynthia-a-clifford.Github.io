## About Me<br>

Hi! 👋🏻 I'm Cynthia Clifford - <br>

I am a former Mechanical Engineer and a former Math Educator who has transitioned to Data Analytics. I love numbers. My superpowers 💪 are analysis, statistics, and sleep.<br>

Feel free to connect 🤝 and say Hi!<br>

About Me:

📊 Started out wanting to do math. 

⚡ Ended up in energy conservation R&D. Great projects but no fun in the individual role and didn’t allow for enough creativity.

🧾 Became a teacher in hopes of inspiring others to love learning as much as I do. And to see the world (I’ve worked in 12 countries).

📊 Teaching AP Statistics, I realized my true passion was analyzing data and using my creativity to communicate findings.

👍🏻 Needed to continue learning with upskilling - started Google’s Data Analytics Career Certificate and then completed the Data Analytics Accelerator Program.

💥 Learned the tools of data analysis: **Excel/Sheets, Tableau, R, SQL, and Python**, applied them to projects, and built a portfolio. 

🤓 The combination of my improving tech skills and my analysis and presentation skills will enable me to make a strong contribution to a company.

🤓 I also bring problem-solving skills, persistence, project management, a strong work ethic, and the flexibility to handle pressure and change with grace.

👑 Joined Stack Education’s Data Analytics program through the University of Vermont and am continually learning.

🔎 Started working a short-term data contract to continue to gain experience in the data world.

🔎 Seeking a full-time permanent role.
