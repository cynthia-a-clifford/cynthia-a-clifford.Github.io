## About Me<br>
My name is Cynthia Clifford. **I love patterns, problem-solving, and going down the rabbit hole to solve juicy problems.**  I am passionate about using data to create actionable insights and inform decision-making. I‚Äôve gained valuable experience through work projects and personal projects, and have a strong foundation in tools and technologies such as **Excel/Sheets, Tableau, Excel, R, and SQL.** I‚Äôm currently learning Python.<br><br>
I have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Education. I have worked as an engineer and as an international school math educator. Through those experiences, I‚Äôve developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills and excellent presentation and communication skills. I know how to **communicate complex ideas in terms that are understandable.** <br><br>
I‚Äôve lived and **worked in 12 countries outside of the US**, demonstrating my flexibility, curiosity, and adaptability. I‚Äôve also been a team leader, department head, and teacher trainer. My experience in leadership has strengthened my analytical and problem-solving abilities, and my desire to use data to improve programs. I want to use these skills to **transition into an analytics role**.<br><br>
I am excited to bring my analytical skills, leadership experience, and education to a data analyst role. I‚Äôm a self-motivated life-long learner and will continue my professional development in this field because it is FUN. I am confident that my combination of education and experience makes me a strong candidate, and I am eager to use my skills to help organizations achieve their goals.<br><br>
On a personal note, I love scuba diving, hiking, yoga, cooking, hiking, music, swimming, and travel.<be>
