  Math teacher transitioning to data analytics. <br>
  I love finding patterns in data.   <br>
  I'm a mechanical engineer turned international school math teacher. 
  I've lived in 13 countries and traveled to many more. Next stop: a data analyst role and a return home to the Mad River Valley in Vermont.
